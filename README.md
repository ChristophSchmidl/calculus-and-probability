# Calculus and Probability

This repository contains all assignments for the course "Calculus and Probability" (IBC017) given at the Radboud University.

## Course objectives

After passing the course students can use:

* Calculus
	* differentiation: product rule, chain rule
	* special functions: exp, log, sin, cos
	* function investigation: maximum/minimum values, roots, partial derivative
	* finding primitives, integration
	* partial integration, substitution

* Probability Theory
	* discrete/continuous probability theory
	* expectation, variance
	* conditional probabilities, Bayes rule, independence


## Literature	

It is not mandatory, but students are advised to obtain a textbook on Calculus. Iâ€™m currently
using the following:

* James Stewart, Single Variable Calculus, Early Transcendentals 7E.
* Kenneth H. Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications.

but any recent textbook on Calculus should be ok.



## Lecture 1: Organisation and derivates (until slide 28 "Recall: Points and lines")

* Different numbers:
	* Natural numbers
	* Integers
	* Rationals
	* Reals
	* Complex
* Numbers: some basic properties
	* Associative laws, for addition and multiplication
	* Commutative laws, for addition and multiplication
	* Distributive law
	* Excistence of an additive and multiplicative identities
	* Existence of additive and multiplicative inverses
* Function - Basic definitions
	* **Functions**		
* More on functions I
	* **Injective, surjective, bijective, isomorphism**
	* **Graph of a real function**
* * More on functions II
	* **Inverse and Composition**
	* **Parity of function (even, odd)**
* Intuition of limit
	* **Approach to limit**
* Example: No limit of sun (1/x) at 0
* Limits
	* **Limit**
* Computation of Limits (**!**)
* Limits involving infinity
	* **Limit**
* Continuous functions
	* **continuous, continuous in point**
* Recall: Points and lines
	* **Slope**
