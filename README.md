# Calculus and Probability

This repository contains all assignments for the course "Calculus and Probability" (IBC017) given at the Radboud University.

## Course objectives

After passing the course students can use:

* Calculus
	* differentiation: product rule, chain rule
	* special functions: exp, log, sin, cos
	* function investigation: maximum/minimum values, roots, partial derivative
	* finding primitives, integration
	* partial integration, substitution

* Probability Theory
	* discrete/continuous probability theory
	* expectation, variance
	* conditional probabilities, Bayes rule, independence


## Literature	

It is not mandatory, but students are advised to obtain a textbook on Calculus. Iâ€™m currently
using the following:

* James Stewart, Single Variable Calculus, Early Transcendentals 7E.
* Kenneth H. Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications.

but any recent textbook on Calculus should be ok.
