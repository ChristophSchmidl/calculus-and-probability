Hello, 

I wasn't able to join the exercise class last friday, so (I guess) I missed the distribution of students in their different groups. 

This means that I don't know my exercise-teacher and the current room for the exercise-session on friday.

Could you help me out with that? I know that I classified myself with "sup" on the first lesson.

Sorry for the inconveniences.


kind regards,
Christoph Schmidl
